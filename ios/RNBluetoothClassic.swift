/**
 Implementation of the RNBluetoothClassic React Native module.  For information on how this
 module was created and developed see the following:
 
 - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-setup
 - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios
 
 or the README.md located in the parent (Javascript) project.
 
 RNBluetoothClassic is responsible for interacting with the ExternalAccessory framework
 and providing wrappers for listing, connecting, reading, writing, etc.  The actual
 communication has been handed off to the BluetoothDevice class - allowing (in the future)
 more that one BluetoothDevice to be connected at one time.
 
 Currently the module communicates using Base64 .utf8 encoded strings.  This should
 be updated in the future to use [UInt8] to match the communication on the
 BluetoothDevice side.  This means that the responsiblity of converting and managing
 data is done in Javascript/client rather than in the module.
