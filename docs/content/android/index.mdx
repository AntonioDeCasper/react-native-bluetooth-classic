## Installation

As previously described the `react-native-bluetooth-classic` is installed through NPM:

```shell
$ npm install react-native-bluetooth-classic --save
```

Once installed [auto linking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) will take over and all that is required is starting the application as normal.  Be sure to check out the previous link if you need to customize or disable the autolinking of this (or any) module.

Auto linking performs the task of dynamically adding the default package:

`new RNBluetoothClassicPackage()`

to your application packages.  This default configuration adds the standard delimited `DeviceConnection`(s):

- **CLIENT** connection type `DelimitedConnectionClientImpl`
- **SERVER** connection type `DelimitedConnectionAcceptImpl`

## API Overview

The primary classes that you may need to work with are:

### RNBluetoothClassicPackage

[RNBluetoothClassicPackage](/android/rn-bluetooth-classic-package/) is responsible for providing the `DeviceConnection` configuration to the `RNBluetoothClassicModule`.  You're able to provide your own implementation to React Native `MainApplication` or `react-native.config.js` file, more information can be found in the [guides](/guides/customize-connection/).

#### RNBluetoothClassicPackage.Builder

[RNBluetoothClassicPackage.Builder](/android/rn-bluetooth-classic-package/#Builder) provides a fluent method for creating the `RNBluetoothClassicPackage`.

### DeviceConnection

[DeviceConnection](/android/device-connection/) the base interface used to manage connections.

#### DelimitedConnectionClientImpl

[DelimitedConnectionClientImpl](/android/delimited-client-impl/) the default implementation for **TYPE = CLIENT** connections.  This `DeviceConnection` manages data by storing it in a `Buffer` providing access based on a specfieid **delimiter**.  The `StandardOptions` used for the client connections are:

- `secure` default `true`
- `delimiter` default `\n`
- `charset` default `ascii`
- `read_timeout` default `300ms`
- `read_size` default `1024`

#### DelimitedConnectionAcceptImpl

[DelimitedConnectionAcceptImpl](/android/delimited-accept-impl/) the default implementation for **TYPE = SERVER** connections.  This `DeviceConnection` manages data by storing it in a `Buffer` providing access based on a specfieid **delimiter**.

The `StandardOptions` used for the client connections are:

- `service_name` default `RNBluetoothClassic
- `secure` default `true`
- `delimiter` default `\n`
- `charset` default `ascii`
- `read_timeout` default `300ms`
- `read_size` default `1024`
