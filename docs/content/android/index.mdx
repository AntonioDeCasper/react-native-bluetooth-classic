## Installation

As previously described the `react-native-bluetooth-classic` is installed through NPM:

```shell
$ npm install react-native-bluetooth-classic --save
```

Once installed [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) will take over and all that is required is starting the application as normal.  Be sure to check out the previous link if you need to customize or disable the autolinking of this (or any) module.

Auto linking performs the task of dynamically adding the default package:

`RNBluetoothClassicPackage.DEFAULT_BUILDER.build()`

to your application packages.  This default configuration adds the standard delimited `DeviceConnection`(s):

- **CLIENT** connection type `DelimitedConnectionClientImpl`
- **SERVER** connection type `DelimitedConnectionAcceptImpl`

## Customized connections

If you need to apply your own connection types, you can do so by creating your implementations and manually linking them into the `RNBluetoothClassicPackage`.  This might be required if you need to:

- Change read/write logic to allow for (a common change) `byte[]` data
- Change the connection/communication types from `BluetoothSocket` to a custom Bluetooth profile

### Manual linking

In order to perform manual linking, you first need to tell your application to disable auto linking for this library.  Information on this can be found [https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md#how-can-i-disable-autolinking-for-unsupported-library](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md#how-can-i-disable-autolinking-for-unsupported-library):

```javascript
// react-native.config.js 
module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    'react-native-bluetooth-classic': {
      platforms: {
        android: null, // disable Android platform, other platforms will still autolink if provided
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Once this is done you can apply your custom configuration to your application:

```java
// MainApplication.java 
RNBluetoothClassicPackage customPackage = RNBluetoothClassicPackage.DEFAULT_BUILDER
  .withFactory("BYTE_ARRAY_CLIENT", new ByteArrayConnectionFactory())
  .build();

// Find me in MainApplication class
private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost =
    new ReactNativeHost(this) {
      @Override
      public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {
      return BuildConfig.DEBUG;
    }

    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        @SuppressWarnings("UnnecessaryLocalVariable")
        List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
        // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
        // packages.add(new MyReactNativePackage());
        packages.add(customPackage);
        return packages;
    }

    @Override
    protected String getJSMainModuleName() {
    return "index";
  }
};
```

You'll now be able to use your connection:

```javascript 
let device[] = await RNBluetoothClassic.getBondedDevices();
let device = devices.find(d => d.name == 'myDevice');
let connected = await device.connect({ TYPE: 'BYTE_ARRAY_CLIENT'});
```
